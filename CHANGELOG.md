# Changelog

All notable changes to the x64dbg MCP Server Plugin will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- CORS support for browser-based MCP clients (e.g. MCP Inspector Web UI):
  - `OPTIONS` preflight handler returns proper CORS headers (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`, `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`, `Access-Control-Max-Age`).
  - All responses now include `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` when the request has a valid `Origin` header.
  - SSE and Streamable HTTP stream responses include `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` (Origin is validated before routing).

## [1.0.9] - 2026-07-13

### Fixed
- Fixed x32dbg stack walking reading saved EBP and return addresses as 8-byte values, which combined adjacent 32-bit stack entries into invalid 64-bit addresses (#12).
- Address formatting now uses 8 hexadecimal digits on x32dbg and 16 on x64dbg.
- ConfigEditor now preserves the `security` section when saving settings.

### Security
- Added `security.host_allowlist` for explicitly trusted FRP/reverse-proxy hostnames and IP addresses while retaining DNS-rebinding protection (#11).
- Host matching is case-insensitive, strips ports, and correctly handles bracketed IPv6 hosts.
- Updated the packaged `config.json` to match secure runtime defaults: memory/register writes and script execution are disabled, and `script.*` is not allowlisted by default.

### Changed
- Version bumped to 1.0.9 across plugin metadata, protocol responses, configuration, and documentation.

## [1.0.8] - 2026-05-25

### Added
- **New MCP tool `debug_attach_pid`** (PR #9 by @qq932024214): attach debugger to an already-running process by PID with proper attach polling and decimal PID support. Plugin commands `mcpattach`/`mcpattachbreak`/`mcpdetach` registered for x64dbg command thread execution. Includes FetchContent fallback for nlohmann_json when vcpkg is not available.

### Security
- **CSRF / DNS-rebinding RCE mitigation** (reported by vonbrubeck via email):
  - All POST endpoints now validate the `Origin` request header against a configurable allowlist (`security.origin_allowlist`, empty by default). Browser-initiated cross-origin POSTs are blocked unless explicitly allowlisted.
  - The `Host` request header is validated against the configured bind address and well-known loopback addresses (`127.0.0.1`, `localhost`, `::1`) to prevent DNS-rebinding attacks.
  - Removed `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` from all HTTP responses. SSE endpoints no longer emit permissive CORS headers.
- Default permissions tightened:
  - `allow_script_execution` changed from `true` to `false` (RCE primitive now strict opt-in).
  - `allow_memory_write` and `allow_register_write` changed from `true` to `false`.
  - `script.*` removed from the default `allowed_methods` wildcard list.
- Rate limiting added: POST endpoints throttled at 100 requests/second (HTTP 429 on excess).
- SSE accumulated buffer capped at 1 MiB per connection (DoS mitigation).
- Dump path traversal protection: `dump.module` and `dump.memory_region` reject `..`, UNC paths, null bytes, and paths exceeding 32767 characters.
- `debug.init` rejects commas in path/arguments/directory to prevent x64dbg command argument confusion.
- `memory.allocate` now uses `PAGE_READWRITE` instead of `PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE` (W^X enforcement).
- CSRF protection extended to SSE streaming endpoints (`GET /sse`, `GET /mcp`).
- Dump output paths now also blocked from targeting sensitive system directories (Windows, System32, Startup).
- Batch JSON-RPC requests capped at 1000 items.
- Breakpoint condition and log text setters now require script execution permission.
- `json::parse(requestId)` wrapped in `SafeParseId()` with exception handling.

### Changed
- Version bumped to 1.0.8 across all version strings, config defaults, and documentation.
- ConfigEditor UI defaults updated to match new secure defaults.
- New `security.origin_allowlist` config section added to default configuration.

### Acknowledgments
- Thanks to **vonbrubeck** for responsibly disclosing the CSRF/DNS-rebinding RCE vulnerability (CWE-352/CWE-350) and providing detailed remediation guidance.
- Thanks to **qq932024214** for contributing the `debug_attach_pid` feature (PR #9).

## [1.0.7] - 2026-05-19

### Added
- **Streamable HTTP transport (MCP 2025-03-26)** — new unified `/mcp` endpoint:
  - `POST /mcp` returns the JSON-RPC response inline as `application/json` (or `202 Accepted` for notifications).
  - `GET /mcp` opens a long-lived SSE stream used solely for server-initiated notifications (no endpoint handshake).
  - `DELETE /mcp` returns `405 Method Not Allowed` (stateless server, no session termination).
  - Recommended over the legacy SSE transport, which has been deprecated by MCP upstream. Configure clients with `"type": "http"` and `"url": "http://127.0.0.1:3000/mcp"`.

### Fixed
- **MCP HTTP+SSE transport handshake was broken**:
  - `GET /sse` now sends the mandatory `event: endpoint` event immediately after the HTTP headers. Without it, clients waited forever for the announcement.
  - `POST /message` now acknowledges with `202 Accepted` (empty body) and delivers the JSON-RPC response via the SSE channel as `event: message`, matching the MCP HTTP+SSE specification. A fallback inline `200 OK + JSON` reply is still returned when no SSE client is attached (so plain HTTP/JSON-RPC tooling like `curl` keeps working).
- **Memory read/search no longer require the debuggee to be paused** (#8). `memory.read` and `memory.search` now require only `IsDebugging()` instead of `IsPaused()`. `ReadProcessMemory` and pattern scanning work fine against a running target — matching the behavior of the x64dbg GUI's Memory Map and Dump panes. `memory.write` still requires a paused debuggee to avoid races with the instruction stream.
- HTTP status reason phrases are now standards-compliant: `202` is reported as `Accepted` (was `OK`); `405 Method Not Allowed` added.

### Changed
- The MCP server's `serverInfo.version` reported during `initialize` now matches the plugin version (1.0.7).

## [1.0.6] - 2026-04-29

### Added
- **New MCP tool `debug_init` / JSON-RPC `debug.init`** — starts a new debug session by loading an executable (mirrors x64dbg's "Run" button). Works regardless of current debug state, so the bot can relaunch the debuggee after a crash/exit/manual stop without the client having to reconnect. Accepts optional `path`, `arguments`, and `current_dir`. When `path` is omitted, the most recently observed debuggee path is reused.

### Changed
- `debug_restart` no longer throws `DebuggerNotRunningException` when the debuggee has already exited — it falls back to the cached path captured from the last `CB_CREATEPROCESS` event (or from a prior `debug_init`/`debug_restart`) so it can revive a dead session.

### Internal
- `DebugController` now caches the debuggee path on `CB_CREATEPROCESS` via `NotifyDebugSessionStarted`; `GetLastDebuggedPath` exposes this for handlers.

## [1.0.5] - 2026-04-29

### Fixed
- `debug_restart` now uses `init "<path>"` instead of non-existent `restart` command (PR #5 by @AMRICHASFUCK)
- Resource count in documentation corrected to "7 direct + 8 templates"

## [1.0.4] - 2026-04-27

### Added
- **12 new MCP tools** (66 → 78 total):
  - `eval_expression` — x64dbg expression evaluator
  - `xref_get` — cross-reference analysis
  - `function_list`, `function_get` — function boundary queries
  - `module_get_exports`, `module_get_imports` — import/export inspection
  - `assembler_assemble` — instruction-to-bytes assembler
  - `bookmark_set`, `bookmark_delete`, `bookmark_list` — bookmark management
  - `patch_list`, `patch_restore` — patch tracking and rollback
- DbgEval-backed address parsing: all address params accept symbols, registers, and expressions
- `memory_search` continuous hex format support (e.g. `4D5A9000`)
- Claude Code plugin (`skills/`) with 11 reverse engineering slash commands
- Skill knowledge base with tool reference and RE pattern cheat sheets

### Changed
- All 10 MCP prompt templates rewritten with multi-phase structured workflows
- `dump_module` ImageBase now uses standard PE default (0x140000000 / 0x400000) instead of ASLR runtime address
- `dump_detect_oep` simplified to single reliable pattern-based strategy

### Removed
- `dump_auto_unpack` — unreliable auto-unpack pipeline
- `dump_fix_imports` — required impractical byte-array parameter
- `dump_rebuild_pe` — required impractical byte-array parameter
- Dead code: `FixImportTable`, `ScyllaRebuildImports`, `FixRelocations`, `DetectOEPByEntropy`, `DetectOEPByExecution`, `RemoveCodeSection` stubs

## [1.0.3] - 2026-03-04

### Fixed
- **Dump/Unpacking Stability and Regression Fixes**
  - Fixed `dump_auto_unpack` false-success behavior where packed images could be copied without real unpacking
  - Fixed import-table fallback corrupting dump section raw layout (`PointerToRawData`/`SizeOfRawData`) and causing runtime crashes
  - Fixed `debug_pause` returning success without actually interrupting a running target in some scenarios
  - Fixed `dump_auto_unpack` default iteration inconsistency:
    - `tools/list` exposed `max_iterations=10` while runtime fallback was `3`
    - runtime default is now aligned to `10`
  - Fixed dump tool behavior in running state:
    - `dump_module` no longer fails with `Debugger is not paused` without recovery attempt
    - `dump_analyze_module` no longer silently misreports `is_packed=false` due to paused-state dependency
    - `dump_detect_oep` no longer fails/misreports when called while target is running
  - Fixed `dump_auto_unpack` failing when invoked while execution context is outside target module range
- **Thread Switching Reliability and State Consistency**
  - Fixed `thread.switch` using decimal TID text (e.g. `8164`) that could be interpreted as hex expression by x64dbg command parser
  - `thread.switch`/`thread.suspend`/`thread.resume` now send explicit `0xHEX` thread IDs to command layer
  - Added post-switch verification loop in `ThreadManager::SwitchThread` to confirm `GetCurrentThreadId()==target` before reporting success
  - Fixed `thread.switch` response mismatch:
    - added `requested_id`
    - `current_id` now reports the actual current thread after switch, not just the requested value

### Changed
- **Generalized Unpacking Logic (No UPX-only Flow)**
  - Generalized transfer/OEP pattern recognition for unpack transitions:
    - `E9 rel32`, `EB rel8`, `FF 25` indirect jump
    - `push imm32; ret`
    - `mov reg, imm; jmp reg` (x86/x64)
    - `movabs reg, imm64; jmp reg` (x64)
  - Reworked packed detection into a layout/heuristic score model instead of UPX-special-case branching
  - Removed `UPX2` hardcoded import fallback and replaced it with generic import-related section heuristics
  - Added automatic paused-state recovery for dump/analyze/OEP detection entry points
  - Added module-context recovery path for `dump_auto_unpack` when invoked mid-run outside target module

## [1.0.2] - 2025-12-16

### Fixed

    - `script_get_last_result`: Added `error` field
    - `stack_read_frame`: Added `encoding` field
    - `dump_memory_region`: Added complete `progress` information

### Changed

  - Unified output directory (`dist/`) for both architectures
  - Parallel compilation with `-j` flag for faster builds
  - Simplified build options: `--clean`, `--x64-only`, `--x86-only`
